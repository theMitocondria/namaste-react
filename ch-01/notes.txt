CDN : Content Delivery Network
It is basically used to deliver photos , videos or data 
acc to geographic access and it works like this if u ask 
react cdn for development.js or react-domdevelpment.js then it will check
ede server where if the content is available it will provide from
there or it will go to us for all data and cache it to edge server.


Now 
1 query : Why does React command work when we use cdn but does not work on create-react-app?
1 : It works because cdn get react.js data globally attached to window object whereas cre... app import react as es6 modules which are not attched to global object.
