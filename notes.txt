Detailed Explanation:
Primitive Types (Pass-by-Value):
When a primitive type is passed to a function, JavaScript creates a copy of the value and assigns it to the parameter. The parameter 
and the original variable hold different values in memory.

Objects (Pass-by-Reference):
When an object is passed to a function, the reference (or memory address) of the object is passed to the parameter. Both the parameter and 
the original variable point to the same object in memory. Consequently, modifications to the object via the parameter are reflected in the original object.

CDN : Content Delivery Network
It is basically used to deliver photos , videos or data 
acc to geographic access and it works like this if u ask 
react cdn for development.js or react-domdevelpment.js then it will check
ede server where if the content is available it will provide from
there or it will go to us for all data and cache it to edge server.

Now 
1 query : Why does React command work when we use cdn but does not work on create-react-app?
1 : It works because cdn get react.js data globally attached to window object whereas cre... app import react as es6 modules which are not attched to global object.

*****Document api ke baare me pdo ace se******

1.React.createElement() jo h wo element nhi bnaega blki ek object bnata h jisko baadme tag em convert kia jata h .. or us ovject ki bhut saari properties hoti h .. see console.log(heading)
2.So I have seen React.createElement() does object creating and so much tedious code so that is why nesting become messy so JSX came into our life.
3.Always remember flow of code is reat-script -> reactdom-script -> appjs 


2 query Where should we place script tag????
    2.1 In head 
        2.1.1 placed in like 
            <head>
                <script scr=""></script>
            </head>
            It will slow down the website as all the script is run before the html is parsed.
        2.1.2 placed in head but with 'defer'
            <head>
                <script scr="" defer></script>
            </head>
            It is similar to placing the script in end of body. because it will wiat for the html to parse then load script
    2.2 send in body
        2.2.1 send in end : recommended pratice as it loads script once hml is parsed ideal for DOM manipulation
        2.2.2 send in top : error dega kyuki wo example kisi element ko access krra h jiski id red h .... but abhi tak dom me wo elment aaya nhi to not recmmmended doing this



Whatever is root rendering will replace if anything is already is present in that tag.

//Library and a framewrork.....
1.React is a Library ...... (some piece of js code) giving us helper method to devlop gfaster applications...
not all frameworks can be added to existing app but react can do that because it is just a small library.
that is why react is only manipulating root.
2.innerhtml vs innertext : https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/silk-test/200/en/silktestworkbench-help-en/SILKTEST-21EEFF3F-DIFFERENCEBETWEENTEXTCONTENTSINNERTEXTINNERHTML-REF.html 

// why to put () these,
const JSXHeading = (
    // isme attributes hmesh camel case me aata h
    <h1 className="head" tabIndex="1">
        I am JSX Heading
    </h1>
)
















DO GIT and GITHUB before everything else because it is necessary

difference between 

1.  devdependency : It is only required while development phase like testing module : Jest , install krne ke liye -D lga do example: npm i -D parcel
    dependency : it is a module which is required for project to run in production

package versions : x.y.z , major . minor . patch update
2.   ~(Tilde) : only jab z ki value change hui tab hoga automatic update (oonly bug fixes , security updates)
     ^(caret) : only jab y , z ki value change hui tab hoga updata means koi features add ho skte h
but ye above dono kaam tabhi aaege jab koi npm i ya noom update run krega na ki khudse uppdate hore
    (GO TO GFG EXACT SMJHA DEGA)btw video me glt btaya h 1:03:26

3.  package.json : It is ID card of any project which tells name of the project , version , dev dependency , dependency etc
                    it is seen by npm i command then it will see ^ , ~ sign from it to configure package.
    package-lock.json : It containds exact version that means source rkhega (integrity) ki konsa krlu download etc. but agr npm update command h to change
                    hoga package-lock.json werna nhi hoga
    (GO TO CHATGPT FOR EXACT SMJHA DEGA)

4.  npm : A commad line tool which is used for installing , running , removing packages.
    npx : A command line ool used when u dont want to install any dependency as it is needed once (If that dependency is already present it will take local version)
          else use it without installing.

5.  react : React is a JavaScript frameowrk for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications.
    react-dom : ReactDOM is a library that provides DOM-specific methods to manage the interaction between React components and the DOM. It serves as the bridge between 
                 React components and the browser's DOM.
                 ReactDOM is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM

6. dist : It is a directory which will be used as production builder , all your JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and other assets are bundled
             and optimized by Parcel and placed in this directory. The files are usually minified and optimized for performance.
   .parcel-cache : it helps to store cached files when we are using parcel as a bundler in our app , it helps in faster reloads and also
            helps to keeps temp files to speed up subsequent build (Jo save hote hi change ho jata h)

NOW : 

1. NPM does not stand for node package manager , yeah it is mostly widely used package manager which uses nodejs as 
its js runtime environment but uski full form wo nhi h. NPM Ek jagah h jaha se hum open sources oackages use 
kr skte h for our own projects

2. Transient dependency : Jese humne koi Parcel package dl kia lekin actual me bhut bada node module isiliye bna kyuki Parcel is our dependencybut parcel will have some of dependency of its 
own and similary they will have dependency this make a recursion and is called transient dependency.

3. Parcel ak bundler h , ab bundler kya hota h ,
    3.1 BUndler ek esi cheej h jo humari website me different js , css , html file ko optimise , load , code splitting (lazy loading ) etc sab krta have
   lekin parcel ke allwa bhi bundler hote h ex: webpack (used in npx create react app) , vite etc sabka kam ek h krene ka tarika alag have

4.  Type module : This means our whole codebase can be split into smaller code packets and it also helps it in import export functionaliyi..
    like when we used React from cdn it is globally available but when we use module then it is available in that where it is imported.

//     )

1. JSX : It stands for Javascript XML and it is syntax extensionin javascript
         which allows you to write HTML code in Js code. 
         ex : const ele = <h2>Ram is a boy </h2>  this is a valid js syntax because of extension
            but remember ye JS ka extension h naki JS , to ye JS engine me execute nhi hogi.
         And also remember JSX ke bina bhi React likhi ja skti h 


2. babel (transpiler || js compiler) : JSX to React needs to be converted because JSX Can not be read 
            by JS Engine in browser  So Babel Came , it is basically ka compiler(JS) or transpiler which 
            converts JSX code or TS code into browser understandable JS.

            EX : const ele = <h1> RAM is a hero </h1>  converted to 
                const ele = React.createElement("h2" , {attributes} , "Ram is a Hero ");

******Always start  a component name in Capital letters************
Component composition: When we nest one component inside other like below by making different functional component in a way we are reusing 
                        smaller components to male a larger component is callled componen composition.

//if i want to make a functional component :
const F1 = function(){
    return (
        <h1>
            <F2/>
            This is a functional Component
        </h1>
    );
}

//second way to wrtite a functional component 
const F2 = ()=>(
    <div>
        <h1>
            This is also right way of writing functional components.
            {/* here {return ()} is replaced by () so dont think why are we not returning */}
        </h1>
    </div>
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

//inside root we can render only react elemenet so <functional /> becomes element(for now)
root.render(<F1/>);

Functional Components are a piece of JS function which returns JSX code or HTML code.

-> Order maintaninence due to const variable variable being in Temporal Dead Zone (WE can not access anything before initialization)
-> cross site scripting is kind of security vulnerablity it occurs when an attacker injects malicious data 
into clients browser and it runs there leading to attacker getting information such as user session , user cookies etc.
-> diff between <Title/> amd <Title></Title> {Title}
    {TITLE} Ese component bhejna tab kaam aata h jab hume ek component doosre component me as a child behjna for example dynamic rendering means jab hume if else lagana ho etc
    <title></title> ese hum jab bhejte h jab hume as a children bhjma ho kis ko (practice me dekho)
-> Why I was able to do Title() 
do above two in detailed way be implementing in code play ground .. hint (<title/> is called when there is no children of the component.whereas <title><title/> is called so we can add childer in between thse two)










//chapter -04 doing coding 
-> HTML components are case insensitive that is does not matter we write <h1> or <H1> they both are same but
JSX is case sensitive by default all the html elemennt are written in first small case letter whereas capital first letter indicate custom JSX element
so <H1> is different frm <h1>
    Summary:
    <h1> is interpreted as an HTML heading element.
    <H1> is interpreted as a custom React component.
-> props , children me difference or props in details:
    Actually ...
    props is just short form of properties isme jitne bhi attributes hum denge jo props ki trh pass honge or wha render ho jaege , lekin children me hum poora ek component bhi bhej skte h
    Purpose:

    Props: Used to pass various types of data (strings, numbers, objects, functions) to a component.
    Children: Specifically used to pass nested elements or components to a component.
-> config driven ui : our website is driven by dataa (controllling ui from data by backend )
why we need key in array

-> <></> this is a fragment this is react fragment element it is kind of cover u can say because it contains multiple element in it self without adding an addition DOM element (bina div ke bhut saare eleemt return 
krne me asaani or ye better h styling pov se bhi semantic pov se bhi)

-> Virtual DOM:React maintains a virtual representation of the UI in memory, which is called the virtual DOM.
When the state or props of a component change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree.

-> reconsilation (how the changes made in code is updated fastly by react , this is a proces of comparing elements then just changing only changed element in actual dom)
-> key rkhni chahiye hmesha kyuki key compare krne me asan hota h konsa change hua h wo krd (even index to nhi krna chahiye)
->If a component's type changes (e.g., from <div> to <span>), React destroys the old component and mounts the new one.
If the component type remains the same, React reuses the existing component instance, updating only the changed props or state.
















///////////////////////////////ch-05/////////////////////////////////

->named export vs default export :

    A: ES6 provides us to import & export a module and use it in other files. ES6 provides two ways to export a module from a file: `named export` and `default export`.
    In `Named export`, one can have multiple named exports per file. Then import the specific exports they want surrounded in `{}` braces. The name of imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module.
    In `Named export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:

        ```
        export const MyComponent = () => {}
        export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
        ```
    and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must use `{}` in MyComponent.
    // ex. importing a single named export
        import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

    // ex. importing multiple named exports
        import { MyComponent, MyComponent2 } from "./MyComponent";

    // ex. giving a named import a different name by using "as":
        import { MyComponent2 as MyNewComponent } from "./MyComponent";
    ```

    In `Default export`, One can have only one default export per file. The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we like.
    In `Default export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:

    ```
        const MyComponent = () => {}
        export default MyComponent;
    ```

    and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must omit `{}` in MyComponent.

    ```
        import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
    ```

    In `* as export`, it is used to import the whole module as a component and access the components inside the module.
    In `* as export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:

    ```
        export const MyComponent = () => {}
        export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
        export const MyComponent3 = () => {}
    ```

    and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like:

    ```
        import * as MainComponents from "./MyComponent";
    ```

    Now we can use them in JSX as:

    ```
        <MainComponents.MyComponent />
        <MainComponents.MyComponent2 />
        <MainComponents.MyComponent3 />
    ```

    We can use `Named export` and `Default export` together. So you should export like:

    ```
        export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
        const MyComponent = () => {}
        export default MyComponent;
    ```

    and import like:

    ```
    import MyComponent, {MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";
```

->hook and its power :
    they are simple js functions which helps us to use state and various react features inside functional components.
->whenever a react state variables update react rerenders the components(react hook is just a js function)
->ultimately virtul dom is js object which do comparison and updates actual dom
->react is doing fast dom manipulation because of virtual dom that is why it is fast
useState hook

(Each hook ke baare me pdna and uska use aana chahaiye wo sikhna h)


























///////////////////////////////////////////ch06/////////////////////////

->Monolith vs Microservice - Architecture , cors , shimer ui
useEffect:
    ->if no dependency array: whatever is written in useEffect it will only be called everytime after the component is re-rendered
        code example : useEffect(()=>{"heelo"}) // no dependency array
    -> when givenn empty dependency array : only be called when window reloads 
        code example : useEffect(()=>{console.log("hii")},[]) // empty array
    -> if there is a dependency in array then : it will be called on initial renders once and after each time the dependent change
        code example : useEffect(()=>{console.log("Hiii")},[btn]) // 1 called first render then each tie btn value change.

useState :
    ->Always create use state in a functional component top (not in if else , not outside component , not in bottom after some functions)

-> always call onClick and other functions like onCLick(()=>{here do your code})// if function not made then infinite calls will be made
-> whole componennt is rerendered as the state value changes

(yaad kr setall(list) se kaam kyu nhi hua)

Routing : react-router-dom:
    ->createBrouserRouter kya krta h , kya h ?
    -> when importing a single default kisi bhi naam se import kr skte h *  as krne ki jrurat nhi h
